## Hey! Glad to see you here!

This is currently a small webpage setup to display my up and coming game which I will be releasing using Python!

Make sure to stay tuned by following this website with a close eye! I will be uploading screenshots, game tutorials or even some live demonstrations!

### This is a test coding bit here:

This has nothing to do with the actual source code of the game, I am just testing out some features of the markdown language that allows me to add code snippets!

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

print("Welcome to my GitHub page")

print("The repository to this page is made publicly available! Feel free to check it out!")

```

### About
  
I am an intermediate software developer currently in the 11th grade. I am 16 years old and I have been learning coding ever since I was a little kid technically speaking.

I started out with flash games using the scratch engine making silly animations. Then I upgraded to flash games by making some games on newgrounds. It was really bad, but that was were my journey began, so to speak.

Ever since I was 10, I was curious about video games, game engines, physics and more. But I didn't bother about them until I was around 13 years old when I started learning about HTML and CSS. My big brother introduced me to the world of programming languages after I made really bad index.html files, through the language called python.

I learned python primarily through codecademy, but at the time I had learnt 2.7x which was not in the trend, after all, python 3.x had been released.

Then I turned about 15, I had a certain level of mastery in pure syntax and modules in python 2.7x and seriously took to learning python as fast and as efficiently as possible.

I am no way in the position of saying I have mastered the language. But, I can say this, I am good at problem solving and creative thinking. Thus most of the mistakes I make while I code is usually due to improper understanding of the language or making silly errors. 

I hope to finish learning python to the best of my abilites, make really fun games and applications, and move on to C++.


### Thank you so much!
